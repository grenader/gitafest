<h3 class="display-6">Address of the property:</h3><p>
534 Gita Nagari Road Port Royal, PA 17082 
</p>
<p>
A non-profit organization established in 1974, Gita Nagari is home to the first and only certified slaughter-free dairy farm in North America. The farm is currently operated by a diverse team of volunteers whose vision is to accelerate global transformation through compassionate living. 
More information can be found here: https://gnecofarm.org/
                </p>

<h3 class="display-6">Property is completely non-smoking</h3><p>
Regarding the cabin: this is by choice of Homeowners. Regarding the entire property: wildfires are a constant threat in our dry Arizona climate. It is simply not an acceptable risk to allow smoking or fires of any kind. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in loss of deposit. 
                </p>

<h3 class="display-6">Pets are not permitted</h3><p>
Although we are animal lovers, due to a number of factors we are unable to allow pets to stay with us. 
                </p>

<h3 class="display-6">“Good Neighbor” clause</h3><p>
The farm is in a quiet, rural, residential area. The beauty of the location is the peacefulness it provides. For these reasons, we require noise to be kept to a minimum after dark (sound travels) out of respect for our neighbors, and Guests need to understand that a generally-accepted “family-friendly” atmosphere is to be maintained at all times (i.e, no loud parties or yelling/swearing, no nakedness outside the privacy of the cabin or inappropriate personal conduct, etc.). Please respect all members of the farm and Household. 
                </p>

<h3 class="display-6">Payment </h3><p>
Your reservation must be paid in full before arriving at the property.  If you have any questions or concerns, then please send e-mail to info@gitafest.com.
                </p>

<h3 class="display-6">Falsified Reservations</h3><p> 
Any reservation obtained under false pretenses of any kind will be subject to forfeiture of advance payment and any other prior arrangements, and the party will not be permitted to check in.
                </p>

<h3 class="display-6">Safety on the farm</h3><p> 
“Guest” understands that the farm is a rural, rustic place. It is a wonderful place to spend time, and kids love the freedom the property allows, but it is not the “city”. There are lots of uneven surfaces, metal, fencing, rocks, dirt and tools of all kinds throughout the property. Trees, shrubs and vegetation of all sorts (including sharp burrs and cactus) may be present. There is no explicit fencing against unwanted critters.  Any fences on the property could be rusty, wires could be sharp, and kids can fall out of trees. We will absolutely assist Guests in utilizing whatever resources are available if anything unfortunate were to happen during your stay, however are not liable for any mishaps. 
                </p>
